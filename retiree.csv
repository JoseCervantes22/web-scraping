Mandatory Deletions,"It is your responsibility to inform ARAG Insurance of changes with your dependents or divorces.

The state has a Mandatory Deletion when an eligible dependent child marries or reaches age 26 (whichever is sooner) as they are no longer eligible for coverage under the insured retiree’s plan. The retiree must complete a new enrollment form if they wish to change to individual coverage when the dependent child loses eligibility.

For legal separations, a deletion of the spouse cannot be done in anticipation of a pending or active divorce action or pending final divorce settlement.  When the divorce is finalized, the retiree must complete a new enrollment form to change their coverage to individual unless you have eligible dependent children on the Plan.

Enrolled retirees who fail to initiate a mandatory deletion within 60 days of the permitting event date will not be reimbursed for the overpayment of premium nor will the carrier provide coverage for family members who no longer meet the eligibility requirement for dependents.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-retiree/retiree-group-legal-insurance-plan/,Retiree Group Legal Insurance Plan
